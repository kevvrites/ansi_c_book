Exercise 1-11: 
- How would you test the word count program? 
- What kinds of input are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any?

1) I would test the word count program by executing it and inputting different sequences of text.

2) The edge cases are the most likely to uncover bugs, so I would do multiple spaces, tabs, newlines, and symbols.
